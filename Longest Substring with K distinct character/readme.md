# Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than **K distinct characters**. <br />
You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.<br />

**Example:** <br/>
longestSubstringWithKdistinct("araaci", 2)//4, The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".
longestSubstringWithKdistinct("araaci", 1)//2, The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".
longestSubstringWithKdistinct("cbbebi", 3)//5, The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".
