Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:
```sh
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
```
Example 2:
```sh
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
```
Example 3:
```sh
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.
```

Constraints:
```sh
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
```
